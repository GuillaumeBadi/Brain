A Clojure library designed to ... well, that part is up to you.

## Algorithm

Permanently generate boolean [genetic functions](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Evolutionary_programming) that maximize the [Shannon entropy](https://www.wikiwand.com/fr/Entropie_de_Shannon) over the labeled dataset.

Functions return either 1 or 0 and split the dataset in to groups, the 1's, the 0's. If the child group has a unique class/label, stop, else recurse.

This process, is in layman's terms: "What is the main diferences within my dataset?"

For example, an example can be represented as a string such as 11001(...) which defines a path in a tree (left, left, right, right, left).
Then a newly element might come in and be associated with a string and automatically be classified

It will then assign for each example a binary string with a fixed size for each example.

Why do that?
The generated functions will provide a binary description of the input. It can then be passed to a deep neural network to be processed or (what we will do here), a [ID3](http://www.wikiwand.com/fr/Algorithme_ID3) tree.

When the new example is linked with a class, it is then already fully annotated

Functions are generated in clojure/ClojureScript.
for example "Is it a dog or a cat?" might be generated by the algorithm like so:

(and (> ears 3.5)
      (or (+ ears (- tail (/ 2 height))))) //...
